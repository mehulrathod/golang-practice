										Learning Golang

                                [NOTE: for improving knowleadge learn about computer science from wikipedia]

// Installing GO in mac
- brew install go

// Checking the Go path
- go env GOPATH
[Note: By default all the project is in default directory is a home directory]

// Go structure
- first line in go is have to be a package name
- next action is import
- next is functions you use the function keyword followed by the name of the function and the first one you'll want is a
 function called main
[Note: it takes no arguments and it doesn't return anything and here the program starts]
- run the program using "go run" followed by the name of the file
[
    package main
    import "fmt"
    func main() {
        fmt.Println("Hello World")
    }
]
- every project at least if you want to be able to execute it needs to have a package called main

// Go Build
- If you want to compile the code into a executable then you can use go build in the programs directory so this time it
doesn't run our code there's not output in the terminal but what has created is the binary file and that is executable
and we can run that in the terminal or alternatively you can use ./filename
Que: Concurrency
Ans: Concurrency is about to run multiple functions at the same time in one function or multiple is depends on
requirements, for achieving concurrency we need go routines and creating go routine is simple as creating a normal
function we can create a go routine just by adding “go” keyword in front of function. Benefits of using Go routines are
they are cheap, lightweight threads of execution.
- For achieving concurrency we also need to use channel

Channel : In Go language, a channel is a medium through which a goroutine communicates with another goroutine and this
communication is lock-free. Or in other words, a channel is a technique which allows to let one goroutine to send data
to another goroutine.

[Note: if you want to compile a code into a executable code than you can use “go build” in the program directory and
this doesn’t give any output in the terminal but what has been created is a one binary file and you can run it through
terminal using ./file_name ]
