Interface :- It defines the behaviour of similar type of objects
Example:
type Shape interface {
    Area() float64
    Diameter() float64
    Perimeter() float64
}

// Go is Object Oriented and in this replacement of classes are structs
Struct :- A struct may have any number of properties and methods defined on them.
Example:
type Rectangle struct {
    Length, Width float64
}
type Circle struct {
    Radius float64
}
